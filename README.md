## Introduction
Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, there were shortages of PPE, toilet paper, and other essential household items. As lockdowns and other pandemic measures are implemented, these shortages could be on a rolling basis.

With **Pandemic Product Finder (PPF)** we aim to be the central health-hub where users can post real-time information on whether essential supplies are in stock at certain stores or where sanitization stations are in the area. 

## Features
### Map
The main feature of PPF is the map! The map we have implemented uses the [Mapbox API](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox provides accurate maps, navigation, and marking. Mapbox also allows us the freedom to further implement navigation and searching features.

### User Driven
Each visitor to PPF can add a marker to their location. When you go out into your community you are able to mark locations for others to see, such as where PPE is in stock, important resources, where sanitizing stations are and stores with COVID friendly policies.
